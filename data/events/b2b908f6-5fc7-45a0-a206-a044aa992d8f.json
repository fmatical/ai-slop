          "text": "Talking Animals Intro: During this minute long clip, animals are interviewed by a human who asks them questions to which they respond with funny answers. It is well thought out and the answers are meant to humor the viewer. The video ranges from dogs in the city to monkeys in the jungle. There are multiple different animals and humans doing the interviewing. The purpose of this video is to generate ideas of what animals think, their motives, and in some scenes their perception of humans, all of which are humorous. This video was created by a youtube account that specializes in generating AI videos for the sole purpose of amusement to its 25,000 subscribers. Each of this page's videos involve animals. This video depicts our group theme of “AI Slop” quite well because it is not possible for animals to converse with humans, so the purpose of this video is strictly to entertain its audience. Each of the responses from the different animals are all very witty and almost taking shots at human things, such as what we do for work. Impossible Tales motto is to give voice to the voiceless in scenarios that would never normally occur but people have definitely imagined before. "
