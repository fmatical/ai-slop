It was created and posted on Youtube by the channel Skilaw AI, which experiments with feeding movies and television shows into AI systems to see how they reinterpret the original content. The result is intentionally awkward and unnatural, as moments that once carried tension, wonder, or emotional growth are turned into something flat and comedic."

However, the awkwardness is the main focus. Scenes that originally relied on critical silence, facial expressions, timing, and pacing are disrupted in all senses. This clash between the original tone and the AI-generated additions creates a sense of disorientation and discomfort that draws attention to what has been replaced."

          "text": "The purpose of creating this “AI slop” version of Harry Potter is not just for humor, but to make a commentary on artificial intelligence in creative spaces. By letting AI alter the scenes based purely on patterns and logic, the video shows what can be lost when storytelling is handled without human emotion or context. It highlights that while AI can technically manipulate media, it does not truly understand tone, character development, or emotional meaning. Ultimately, the video encourages viewers to think about the limits of AI in creative spaces and how important human perspective is in making stories meaningful."
