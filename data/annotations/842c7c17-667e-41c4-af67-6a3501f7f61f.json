              "text": "The video’s precise one minute runtime is actually a deliberate choice made by the communicator. On short form platforms, videos that are around sixty seconds are more likely to be watched all the way through and sometimes loop automatically. When viewers finish a video, the platform reads that as strong engagement and is more likely to recommend it to others. Because of this, creators who use AI often shape their stories to fit this time limit instead of letting events unfold naturally. In this video, major plot points happen back to back, moving from childhood to school, to exile, to training, and finally to reunion in a very short span. The pacing feels rushed because the goal is to maintain the attention of the young audience. The one minute format makes the video feel complete while still requiring very little time from the viewer. This is a general trend that we can see on any social media platform. There are even jokes centered around content creators dragging their videos out with meaningless direction in order to hit a time threshold. It is obvious that this is not only constrained to real people, but synthetic media as well."

              "text": "The use of headbands resembling those worn by characters in Naruto connects this video to a global pop-culture reference. In Naruto, headbands are closely tied to identity, training, and allegiance, especially within a world centered on ninjas and assassins. By borrowing this visual symbol, the video quickly signals that its characters belong to a similar world without needing explanation. This reference works as a shortcut for the audience, viewers who are probably familiar with anime, who can immediately understand the role and tone of the characters. I believe the headbands also help \"legitimize\" the story on a socio-cultural level, where meaning in media is often built through recognizable references."

Unlike assassination, which is hidden and illegal, fencing is known and publicly accepted. Fencing also gives the narrative a clear goal in the form of training and competition, which helps move the plot forward quickly within a short runtime. Without the fencing competition plot line, there would be no substance for the video. As soon as the video started, the audience was introduced to the idea of a fencing academy. For viewers, fencing is familiar enough to understand but still visually associated with combat, and by using fencing, the video creates a clear plot twist time stamp when Cappuccino’s identity is exposed, showing how a socially acceptable activity becomes a site for exclusion."
