              "text": "The scene really leans into emotion to make the viewer feel proud of the wooden child and happy that he’s being accepted. He looks the same as everyone else in the green classroom, which gives the wooden child a sense that he finally belongs. When he randomly stands up and starts dancing, everyone looks at him. The teacher clapping right away is important because it shows an authority figure approving of him, which makes the audience feel even more supportive. When the teacher tells him to sign up for the dance competition, it pushes the idea that he’s not just fitting in, but actually succeeding. The scene happens really fast, but it still creates a strong emotional connection."
