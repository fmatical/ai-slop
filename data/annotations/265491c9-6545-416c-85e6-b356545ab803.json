              "text": "The scene really leans into emotion to make the viewer feel proud of the wooden child and happy that he’s being accepted. He looks the same as everyone else in the green classroom, which gives the wooden child a sense that he finally belongs. When he randomly stands up and starts dancing, everyone looks at him. The teacher clapping right away is important because it shows an authority figure approving of him, which makes the audience feel even more supportive. When the teacher tells him to sign up for the dance competition, it pushes the idea that he’s not just fitting in, but actually succeeding. The scene happens really fast, but it still creates a strong emotional connection."

The winners’ podium ranks the students, and placing him at the top suggests that he has not only fit into the institution but has excelled. The green man in a suit shaking his hand works as a symbol of authority and official recognition, almost like an administrator or sponsor, which shows that his achievement is being validated by the system itself. This moment communicates to the audience that his talent is real and respected, not just accepted by classmates but rewarded. By using these familiar images of competition and ceremony, the video makes his success feel credible and meaningful, which strengthens the impact of the later reveal."
